#### About the project:

My intention with this project is to first of all use the knowledge from this course in HTML, CSS and Javascript, but also doing somthing that can grow over time and be improved with additional functionality as we proceed.
The project is a Homecontrol application, where you should be able to manage your home remotely. E.g. turning on and off the lights, manage the alarm, your network/Wifi, etc.
In this first version, I have focused on managing the light control being able visualise how you can turn lightswitches on and off in a particual room, but also add aditional lights to a room as well as adding additional rooms.

#### Technologies used 

* HTML for structure.
* CSS for design.
* Bootstrap 3 for additional structure/styling.
* JavaScript/jQuery for functionality.
* Git for version control.

#### Additional descriptions 

* index.html is the main file where all the content is.
* style.css: This is my own stylesheet for the project and whats controling the overall layout.
* script.js: This is the file with my different javaScript and jQuery script is.
* JavaScript: I have used javascript to for DOM manipulation when adding a new room, using eventlistner. 
* jQuery: I have used jQuery also for DOM manipulation when turing the lightswitches on and off but also when adding a new light to the room. I have also used it to manipulate the first landing page with fade the bottons when you hover.
* Bootstrap: I have worked with the grid system to get the page to be responsive, I have also used the build in style for nav-bar and buttons.
I chose to make this site a "desktop first" with bootstrap it's also adjusted for both mobile and tablet devices. 

Overall I am  satisfied with what I have created based on the knowledge I have learned so far, but there are of course areas that can be improved, both on existing functionality but also when adding new things to the home control system and also connecting a backend to it so that you could really use it.

#### Areas for improvement on current version

* Using other input forms, e.g. modal
* Some parts are today static created HTML. Most of the thins should be dynamically created.
* Add login options
* Add timer function to the lights
* Add dimmer function to the lights by using a slider
* Work a bit on the layout. Use images for the lights instead of boxes.
* Other lightswithes


#### Additional functionality to be added
* Currently only the light control board is working. Next is to also add similar controlboards for the WiFi, temperature control, and survalience cameras and alarms

* Connect the front end to a real backend system, but be able to actually control certain things. Longterm plan to connect to Tedus Tellstick, Raspberry Pi or similar.
